# Bracket Creator
A simple web app that allows users to create brackets with rounds and selectable sizes. I built this app due to an annoyance of not being able to find bracket sites online that arent loaded with ads or unnecessary features. 
Inspiration came to me after I watched the Evo 2016 Melee finals and thought about how cool top 8s are.
